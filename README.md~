# README

This repository was created in order to provide didactical material for the **Introduction to Machine Learning for biomedical data analysis in Python** course, taught by Dr. Adriano Barbosa-Silva in various Data Science for Health courses.

This repository uses resources collected from diverse sources in the internet. Credits should be given for the authors listed below, from whom I obtained the original material for free code at Kaggle for teaching purposes. They deserve full credits for their great work!
